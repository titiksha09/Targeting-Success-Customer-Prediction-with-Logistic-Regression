Predicting the Right Customer Using Logistic Regression Model
Introduction
This project aims to build a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a customer taking a desired action, such as purchasing a product or subscribing to a service. The logistic regression model is a popular statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the outcome variable can take one of two possible values.
